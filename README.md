# Pylot
A simple Python plotter with a simple graphical user interface, GUI.

Plotting data is a key part of any science and there are a lot of software solutions designed for this purpose, e.g. Excel, Veusz, gnuplot etc... These are all excellent options but something which I often need is a means to quickly plot multiple data files for comparison and have the plot look half-decent for a presentation. 

Pylot is a very simple Python program which offers a GUI for quick plotting of single or multiple data files. If you want to see more about how it works, visit my [T>T blog post](https://adambaskerville.github.io/posts/PythonGUIPlotter/)

It offers colour selection, line styles, legend labels and recognises LaTeX math syntax. This is what the GUI looks like when you use it:

I use this program regularly in my work and I hope it can prove useful for you.
